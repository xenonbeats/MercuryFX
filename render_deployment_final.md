# Final Render Deployment Instructions for MercuryFX V2

## What You Just Did âœ…
- Updated requirements.txt to remove TA-Lib
- I've now fixed your technical_analysis.py file to use the 'ta' library instead

## Next Steps for Render:

### 1. Copy Your Updated Files to GitHub
Your files are now Render-compatible. Upload these to your GitHub repository:

**Updated Files:**
- `requirements.txt` (you already did this)
- `technical_analysis.py` (now fixed for Render)
- All other files remain the same

### 2. Render Settings (Keep Same)
- Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start Command: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`
- Environment Variables: TELEGRAM_TOKEN, CHAT_ID, SESSION_SECRET

### 3. Deploy and Monitor
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Render will auto-rebuild (if auto-deploy enabled)
3. Watch build logs for SUCCESS messages
4. Should complete in 3-5 minutes

## What Changed in technical_analysis.py:
```python
# OLD (caused Render errors):
import talib
df['ema50'] = talib.EMA(df['Close'], timeperiod=50)

# NEW (Render compatible):
import ta
df['ema50'] = ta.trend.ema_indicator(df['Close'], window=50)
```

## Expected Success Messages:
```
Successfully installed flask-3.0.3 gunicorn-23.0.0 numpy-1.26.4 pandas-2.2.2 python-dotenv-1.0.1 python-telegram-bot-21.4 requests-2.32.3 yfinance-0.2.28 ta-0.11.0
Build succeeded
Starting gunicorn
```

Your trading signals will work exactly the same - just with a library that actually compiles on Render!
